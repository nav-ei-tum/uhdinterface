Software dependencies
=====================
In order to compile and run this interface both the Ettus UHD and Matlab
must be installed. As Matlab ignores the system's boost libraries and uses
it's own ones UHD must be compiled against the same boost version as Matlab
is using.

Known combinations:
Matlab Boost
------ ------
R2010b 1.40.0
R2011a 1.40.0
R2011b 1.44.0


Install from Matlab
===================
To install the Matlab UHD wrapper, open matlab and switch to either the
source code directory 'mex' or the matlab example code directory
'matlab_mex'. For the latter one make sure the source code directory is in
path by running the 'startup.m' script in 'matlab_mex'.

Make sure you mex environment is properly set up. At least run through
'mex -setup'

Then run the 'make.m' script, which will compile the interface and generate
the mex library 'uhdinterface.mex###' with ### being an apendix based on
your system.

To use the mex file in the futue make sure that this generated mex file is
in your matlab path.


Install from outside Matlab
===========================
It is also possible to compile the wrapper from outside Matlab, as the mex
script is only invoking your system's compiler to generate a shared library
that is exporting the mexFunction interface. This is however very system
dependant and you are referred to existing documentation on the Internet.
